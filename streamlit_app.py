    [Neeyah](https://neeyah.com/) is an alternative to conventional mortgages for Muslim home buyers through the use of a technique called [Musharakah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_and_loss_sharing#Musharakah). Since this method of home ownership is not common in the United States, this calculator was created to help home buyers better understand a potential payment structure.

    Input specific information about your potential home purchase to calculate a payment schedule.

        ### How Does Home Ownership with Neeyah Work?
        1. **Identify and Purchase a Home with Neeyah**
        Buy a minimum 20% and Neeyah buys the rest.
        2. **Make Monthly Payments**
        Pay rent for the portion of the home you don't own yet, while Neeyah pays for its fair share of home expenses. *Anything you pay in excess of your rental percentage is what is used to purchase Neeyah's share of the home.*
        3. **Sell anytime or reach 100% ownership.**
        You decide when to sell the home, or reach sole ownership. *You can pay more to increase your equity in the home and reach sole ownership sooner *
